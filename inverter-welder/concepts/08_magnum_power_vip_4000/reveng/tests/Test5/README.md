# Test 5: check how output voltage changes with additional PWM signal on pin 9 of SG3525A

Build an external PWM generator using Arduino, just like in [this test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wmarkow/sandbox/master/inverter-welder/elements/sg3525/tests/Test5/README.md)

Connect the collector of the transistor to pin 9 of SG3525A in Magnum Power VIP 4000. \
Attach first scope to the collector of transistor (or to pin 9 of SG3525A); \
Attach second scope directly to the welder's positive ouput clamp. \
Attach multimeter to the welder's positive ouput clamp. \
Magnum Power VIP 4000 is not loaded: no additional load is attached to the output clamps.

The expectations of this test are:
 * to see if the average output positive clamp voltage will drop
 * to see if it possible to have 30V on the output with a highest possible frequency of external PWM signal. This is a good idle voltage to start experimenting with MIG welding.

Additional remarks to oscillograms:
 * signal at the top half of the view (looks like a shark's finn) is from pin 9 of SG2325
   * time per div is 5us
   * voltage per div is always 5V
   * max voltage value is around 5V
 * signal at the bottom part of the view is from output positive clamp
   * time per div is 5us
   * voltage per div is 15V
   * min voltage value is around  0V
   * max voltage value is around 65V

Note that signal on pin 9 is an inverted version of PWM generated by Arduino, thus the duty cycle on pin 9 has a different value.
