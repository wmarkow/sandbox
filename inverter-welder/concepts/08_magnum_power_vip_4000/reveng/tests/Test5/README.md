# Test 5: check how output voltage changes with additional PWM signal on pin 9 of SG3525A

Build an external PWM generator using Arduino, just like the one in [this test](https://github.com/wmarkow/sandbox/blob/master/inverter-welder/elements/sg3525/tests/Test5/README.md)

Connect the collector of the transistor to pin 9 of SG3525A in Magnum Power VIP 4000. \
Attach first scope to the collector of transistor (or to pin 9 of SG3525A); \
Attach second scope directly to the welder's positive ouput clamp. \
Attach multimeter to the welder's positive ouput clamp. \
Magnum Power VIP 4000 is not loaded: no additional load is attached to the output clamps.

The expectations of this test are:
 * to see if the average output positive clamp voltage will drop
 * to see if it possible to have 30V on the output with a highest possible frequency of external PWM signal. This is a good voltage to start experimenting with MIG welding.

Additional remarks to oscillograms:
 * signal at the top half of the view (looks like a shark's finn) is from pin 9 of SG2325
   * time per div is given in the table
   * voltage per div is always 5V
   * max voltage value is around 5V
 * signal at the bottom part of the view is from output positive clamp
   * time per div is given in the table
   * voltage per div is 15V
   * min voltage value is around  0V
   * max voltage value is around 65V

Note that signal on pin 9 is an inverted version of PWM generated by Arduino, thus the duty cycle on pin 9 has a different value.

No. It looks that the output voltage doesn't drop immediatelly.|

The voltage drops to 20V but average voltage of the signal is about 30V. This is what I want but I'm not happy with the PWM frequency: 1468 Hz|

Conclusions: the voltage doesn't drop immediatelly as I tought. It will be not so easy to lower the output voltage to the 30V. Of course it can be finally done with 1468 Hz PWM signal
witj 3.125% of duty cycle. I'm not quote sure what will happen if I start MIG welding. And the main question: why the voltage drops so slow?
