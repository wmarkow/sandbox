# Hardware tests of Magnum Power VIP 4000 welder

I wanted to modify my Magnum Power VIP 4000 welder, so it can also be used as a MIG machine.
My idea is to use Soft-Start pin of SG3525 to lower the idle voltage from 62V to 30V.
See [SG3225 tests results](https://github.com/wmarkow/sandbox/tree/master/inverter-welder/elements/sg3525/tests) for reference 
on how to do it with SG3525 and a variable resistor.
For some reason it doesn't work: the output idle voltage doesn't follow the changes of PWM signal generated by SG3525; it is
almost all the time around 60V. Only when PWM is set to 5% then the output idle voltage drops drastically to around 10V.

In this document I cover some hardware tests of Power VIP 400 device to see what is going on.

In all tests a 100k variable resistor is attached between ground and Soft-Start pin of SG3525. This allows to feed Soft-Start pin with variable voltage between 0 and 4V.

## Test 1: check how output idle voltage changes with PWM output (pin 11 of SG3525)

Additional remarks to oscillograms:
 * signal at the top is from pin 11 of SG2325
   * time per div is always 5us
   * voltage per div is always 5V
   * max voltage value is around 15V
 * signal at the bottom is from output positive clamp
   * time per div is always 5us
   * voltage per div is always 15V
   * max voltage value is around 65V

The output voltage doesn't react much on the PWM signal generated by SG3525. What is true: when PWM goes down almost to 0%
then the output idle voltage also goes down. I tought that will react smoothly on PWM.

## Test 2: check how voltage of pin 4 of VT1 chip (this is probably a half bridge with two MOSFETs) changes with PWM output (pin 11 of SG3525)

VT1 chip is powered up with 15.8V

   * time per div is always 5us

 The voltage on pin 4 of VT1 reacts on voltage on the PWM signal (generated by pin 11 of SG3525) - this seems to work correctly - and seems to be around 6V greater.
