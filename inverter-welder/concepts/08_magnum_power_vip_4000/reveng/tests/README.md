# Hardware tests of Magnum Power VIP 4000 welder

I wanted to modify my Magnum Power VIP 4000 welder, so it can also be used as a MIG machine.
My idea is to use Soft-Start pin of SG3525 to lower the idle voltage from 62V to 30V.
See [SG3225 tests results](https://github.com/wmarkow/sandbox/tree/master/inverter-welder/elements/sg3525/tests) for reference 
on how to do it with SG3525 and a variable resistor.
For some reason it doesn't work when it is used in Magnum Power VIP 4000 device; the output idle voltage doesn't follow the changes of PWM signal generated by SG3525. It is
almost all the time around 60V. Only when PWM is set to 5% then the output idle voltage drops drastically to around 10V.

In this document I cover some hardware tests of Power VIP 400 device to see what is going on and to better understand how the device works.

## Test 1: check how output idle voltage changes with PWM output (pin 11 of SG3525)

## Test 2: check how voltage of pin 4 of VT1 chip (this is probably a half bridge with two MOSFETs) changes with PWM output (pin 11 of SG3525)

## Test 3: check how voltage of pin 5 of VT1 chip changes with PWM output (pin 11 of SG3525)
