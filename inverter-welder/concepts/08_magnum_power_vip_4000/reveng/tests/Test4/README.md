# Test 4: check how output coil idle voltage changes with SG3525A pin 8 (Soft-Start)

Attach a 100k variable resistor between ground and Soft-Start (pin 8) pin of SG3525A. \
Attach one scope to pin 11 of SG3515A. \
Attach second scope directly to one of the output coils of the output trafo. \
Attach multimeter to the output clamps. \

Change the variable resistor to set a different voltage on pin 8 and observe the signals.

Additional remarks to oscillograms:
 * signal at the top half of the view (looks like a shark's finn) is from pin 11 of SG2325
   * time per div is 5us
   * voltage per div is always 5V
   * max voltage value is around 15V
 * signal at the whole part of the view is from output coil
   * time per div is 5us
   * voltage per div is 15V
   * min voltage value is around -65V
   * max voltage value is around  65V

The output voltage doesn't react much on the PWM signal generated by SG3525. The wide of signal ramains mostly the same.
What is true: when PWM goes down to around 5% then the output idle voltage also goes drastically down. I tought that will react smoothly on PWM.
