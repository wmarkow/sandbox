# Test 1: check how output idle voltage and pin 11 of SG3525 change with SG3525A pin 8 (Soft-Start) when no load attached to the welder

Date of test: 16th November 2020 \
 \
Attach a 100k variable resistor between ground and Soft-Start (pin 8) pin of SG3525A. \
Attach one scope to pin 11 of SG3515A. \
Attach second scope to output of positive clamp. \
Magnum Power VIP 4000 is not loaded: no balast is attached to the output clamps.

Change the variable resistor to set a different voltage on pin 8 and observe the signals.


Additional remarks to oscillograms:
 * signal at the top is from pin 11 of SG2325
   * time per div is 5us
   * voltage per div is 5V
   * max voltage value is around 15V
 * signal at the bottom is from output positive clamp
   * time per div is 5us
   * voltage per div is 15V
   * max voltage value is around 65V

The output voltage doesn't react much on the PWM signal generated by SG3525. What is true: when PWM goes down around to 5%
then the output idle voltage also goes drastically down. I tought that will react smoothly on PWM.
