# Test 2: check how voltages of pin 11 of SG3525A and pin 4 of VT1 chip changes with SG3525A pin 8 (Soft-Start)

Chip VT1 (and also VT2) is probably a half bridge with two MOSFETs. Both chips create a H-bridge which drives the coil voltage.\
The vltage from this coil is used later to drive the IGBT transistors.

Attach a 100k variable resistor between ground and Soft-Start (pin 8) pin of SG3525A. \
Attach one scope to pin 11 of SG3515A. \
Attach second scope to pin 4 of VT1 chip. \
Magnum Power VIP 4000 is not loaded: no balast is attached to the output clamps.

Change the variable resistor to set a different voltage on pin 8 and observe the signals.

VT1 chip is powered up with 15.8V

Additional remarks to oscillograms:
 * signal at the top is from pin 11 of SG2325
   * time per div is 5us
   * voltage per div is 5V
   * max voltage value is around 15V
 * signal at the bottom is from pin 4 of VT1 element
   * time per div is 5us
   * voltage per div is 5V
   * max voltage value is around 20V

 The voltage on pin 4 of VT1 reacts on voltage on the PWM signal (generated by pin 11 of SG3525) - this seems to work correctly.
