# Test 4: limit PWM duty cycle with Soft-Start pin.
In this test by attaching a variable resitor to the Soft-Start pin we limit the duty cycle of generated PWM signal no matter what voltage is generated by error amplifier. \
Soft-Start mechanism is left intact. \
It will probably also work when error amplifier is configured as voltage follower.

Error amplifier is configured as a comparator:
 * pin 1 conected to ground
 * pin 2 connected to 5V
 
This should generate the PWM with 50% duty cycle on the output pins 11 and 14 but the duty cycle can be lowered by using variable resistor attached to pin 8.
It is adviced to use max 100k potentiometer. Together with chip's internal 50uA current source, it will generate max 5V on pin 8, 
which is good enough to limit the duty cycle between 0% and 50%.
